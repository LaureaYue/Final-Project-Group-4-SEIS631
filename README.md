## Summary

After breaking down Zillow's Forecasting Data into US Regions (Northeast, South, Midwest, West), home values prices are expected to increase highest for the Northeast and Southwest in the short-term (month ahead & quarter ahead), and Northeast in the longer term (year ahead, overall). Specific states with the three highest forecasted home value increases in the Northeast are: NJ, NH, and ME. The lowest are VT, NY, and PA

From January 2023 to October 2024, median home values steadily increased from $219k to $235k across all U.S. regions. Inventory followed a typical seasonal pattern, peaking in summer and dipping in winter, with summer 2024 inventory levels surpassing those of 2023. Declining interest rates have encouraged more homeowners to list their properties, and rising home values and YoY inventory growth are expected to continue.

On average all four regions moved to a pending state at a similar rate, while the northeast region was slightly quicker. However when looking at average days to closing we can see the northeast region takes significantly longer, around 2 standard deviations. If the investor is not concerned with waiting a few extra days on average to close a sale, then we still suggest the northeast real estate market.
