## Summary

After breaking down Zillow's Forecasting Data into US Regions (Northeast, South, Midwest, West), home value prices are expected to increase highest for the Northeast and Southwest in the short-term (month ahead & quarter ahead) and Northeast in the longer term (year ahead, overall). Specific states with the three highest forecasted home value increases in the Northeast are NJ, NH, and ME. The lowest are VT, NY, and PA.

From January 2023 to October 2024, median home values steadily increased from $219k to $235k across all U.S. regions. Inventory followed a typical seasonal pattern, peaking in summer and dipping in winter, with summer 2024 inventory levels surpassing those of 2023. Declining interest rates have encouraged more homeowners to list their properties, and rising home values and YoY inventory growth are expected to continue.

Recent growth rate by state for single-family homes from 2023- 2024 shows that the top 10 states, Connecticut, New Jersey, Rhode Island, New Hampshire, New York, Massachusetts, Maine, Wisconsin, Ohio, and Illinois, respectively, were the top performers. Notably, the top 7 states are all in the North Eastern Region.

When it comes to all homes, the home price growth forecast shows a positive increase from November 2024 to January 2025, which then exponentially increases in October 2025.

The top 10 states by Average Home price growth showed how competitive the North Eastern Region is. New Hampshire recorded the highest growth at 2.44%, followed by New Jersey at 2.28 %, Maine at third with 2.12, Connecticut placed fourth with 1.82, and Montana, the only state in the top 5 outside of the North Eastern region.

The state-by-state growth forecast for the states in the top 10 (growth ) using ARIMA showed a 6-month growth forecast of the home value growth for all the states. The best places to Invest in the North Eastern region are New Hampshire, Maine, and New Jersey.

Regarding timing: Invest now because the market forecast is showing positive growth; invest in the North Eastern Region, particularly Maine, New Jersey, and New Hampshire

On average, all four regions moved to a pending state at a similar rate, while the northeast region was slightly quicker. However, when looking at average days to closing, we can see the northeast region takes significantly longer, around two standard deviations. If the investor is not concerned with waiting a few extra days on average to close a sale, then we still suggest the northeast real estate market.

Now is an excellent time to invest, but which strategy should you chooseâ€”selling or renting out? If your goal is to invest and then sell, the Northeast and South regions stand out, offering impressive returns. These regions boast Return on Investment (ROI) rates as high as 42% for selling. In the Northeast, Massachusetts emerges as the top state for maximizing ROI. For those interested in flipping and selling properties in other areas, our detailed report lists the top 20 states with ROIs ranging from 18% to 42%.

On the other hand, if renting out properties is your preferred investment strategy, the Midwest offers the best opportunities. Despite ranking lowest for ROI in selling, the Midwest achieves an average ROI of 5% for rental properties. At the state level, West Virginia stands out as the most promising for rental investments. Among major metro areas, Oak Harbor, Washington, leads with an impressive 35% ROI for rental properties. At the same time, San Jose, California, ranks as the least favorable, with a negative ROI of -18% for landlords.

In summary, the Northeast region remains the most competitive and promising market for real estate investments, with states like New Hampshire, New Jersey, and Maine leading in home value growth and ROI potential. Whether pursuing a selling or rental strategy, investors can capitalize on these trends to maximize returns in a steadily growing housing market.
