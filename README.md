## Summary

After breaking down Zillow's Forecasting Data into US Regions (Northeast, South, Midwest, West), home values prices are expected to increase highest for the Northeast and Southwest in the short-term (month ahead & quarter ahead), and Northeast in the longer term (year ahead, overall). Specific states with the three highest forecasted home value increases in the Northeast are: NJ, NH, and ME. The lowest are VT, NY, and PA

From January 2023 to October 2024, median home values steadily increased from $219k to $235k across all U.S. regions. Inventory followed a typical seasonal pattern, peaking in summer and dipping in winter, with summer 2024 inventory levels surpassing those of 2023. Declining interest rates have encouraged more homeowners to list their properties, and rising home values and YoY inventory growth are expected to continue.

Recent growth rate by state for single family homes from 2023- 2024 show that the top 10 states that Connecticut , New Jersey , Rhode Island , New Hampshire , New York , Massachusetts , Maine , Wisconsin , Ohio and Illinois respectively were the top performers. It is noteworthy that the top 7 states are all in the North Eastern Region.

When it came to all homes the home price growth forecast shows that there is positive increase from November 2024 to January 2025 which then exponentially increase in October 2025.

The top 10 states by Average Home price growth showed how competitive the North Eastern Region is .New Hampshire recording the highest growth at 2.44%, followed by New Jersey at 2.28 %, Maine being third with 2.12 , Connecticut placed fourth with 1.82 and Montana , the only state in top 5 outside of the North Eastern region .

The state by state growth forecast for the states in top 10 (growth ) using ARIMA showed a 6 month growth forecast of the home value growth for all the states . The best places to Invest in the North Eastern region are New Hampshire , Maine and New Jersey

Invest now because the market forecast is showing positive growth.

Invest in the North Eastern Region particularly Maine, New Jersey and New Hampshire

On average all four regions moved to a pending state at a similar rate, while the northeast region was slightly quicker. However when looking at average days to closing we can see the northeast region takes significantly longer, around 2 standard deviations. If the investor is not concerned with waiting a few extra days on average to close a sale, then we still suggest the northeast real estate market.
